This is my small project for learning how to build backend for websites in python
with Flask. 

## Features
 - ability to login and create an account 
 - posting and reading blog posts
 - upvoting and downvoting posts

## How to launch
 - clone this git repository 
 - in main directory create new python virtual environment :
    ```python -m venv ./.venv```
 - activate the virtual environment:
    - Linux: ```sourve .venv/bin/activate```
 - install all required dependencies:
    ```pip install -r requirements. txt```
 - run flask development server:
    ```flask --app myblog --debug run```
 - now you can open the link that will be shown in your browser and see the website!
